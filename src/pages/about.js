      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>The best way I’ve ever known how to connect with people was through
       stories. I grew up in rural Illinois, in a place where people either
       learn to tell themselves stories or kill themselves. I saw it happen
       again and again; I saw the joy on my friends’ faces when we watched
       movies, talked comics, played video games. And, eventually, I realized
       I could make those things. </p>

       <p>I got my love of genre film from my dad. Star Wars, Blade Runner, so on.
       My mom introduced me to the films of Hollywood’s Second Golden Age, which
       have probably been more influential for me. Movies such as The Godfather
       and Bonnie and Clyde. It was when I saw, thanks to the film’s comic book
       connections, Chasing Amy that I first felt the director pouring themselves
       into the work. So I decided to make movies, to talk about love and relationships
       they way those films continue to.</p>

      <p>I left Illinois to come to grad school, looking to explore narrative theory,
      experimental art, and other media. I’ve also had to question and create who I am,
       what I stand for, and what I want out of life. Which isn’t atypical, but I had
       convinced myself I was pretty much a straight man. I’ve pretty much processed
       that, but will probably have to do so again. My art is very much a part of that
       process, and I’m glad to share it with my audiences.</p>
